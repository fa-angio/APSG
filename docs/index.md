# The Authoritarian Political Systems Group


The Authoritarian Political Systems Group (APSG) is an online seminar series for researchers studying issues of authoritarian politics. We intend to connect researchers working on different aspects of autocracies and with different regional concentrations. Our bi-weekly seminar will provide an opportunity to receive feedback on their work in progress.

We welcome presentations by scholars in comparative politics, international relations, and political theory as well as with different methodological approaches (e.g., qualitative, quantitative, formal modeling, etc.). We particularly encourage submissions from traditionally underrepresented groups including women and minorities, as well as early-carreer scholars (e.g., graduate students, post-docs, junior faculty).

The APSG online seminar will be held every other week on Tuesdays between **5:00-6:00 PM Central European Time (8:00-9:00 AM PST, 11:00-12:00 AM EST)**. The workshop will last one hour. After a brief presentation by the author(s), two discussants will provide comments and suggestions. We then open the floor for further questions and comments from the audience.

Louis-Philippe is a PhD student in comparative politics at Cornell, studying authoritarian politics in post-communist societies. He is particularly attentive to the role that identity, affect, and memory play in either inspiring or discouraging resistance to authoritarian regimes, as well as to how authoritarian elites seek to legitimate their rule. Research on historical persistence, religion, and the legacies of violence also fall within the purview of my scholarly interests.
