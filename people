Louis-Philippe is a PhD student in comparative politics at Cornell, studying authoritarian politics in post-communist societies. He is particularly attentive to the role that identity, affect, and memory play in either inspiring or discouraging resistance to authoritarian regimes, as well as to how authoritarian elites seek to legitimate their rule. Research on historical persistence, religion, and the legacies of violence also fall within the purview of my scholarly interests.
