**[Fabio Angiolillo] (https://www.fangiolillo.com)**

Fabio is a PhD candidate at the Department of Politics and Public Administration at The University of Hong Kong (HKU). During the Academic Year 2021/2022, I will be visiting the Department of Government at Cornell.

His research interests center on comparative politics, authoritarian political institutions, political behavior, and political economy. I combine quantitative methods, time series, panel data, and extensive qualitative fieldwork research.

In his dissertation, he explores the interaction between ruling parties and citizens in closed authoritarian regimes, the strategies ruling parties implement to maintain stability, and citizens political behavior towards the ruling party.
