Fabio is a PhD candidate at the Department of Politics and Public Administration at The University of Hong Kong (HKU). During the Academic Year 2021/2022, I will be visiting the Department of Government at Cornell.

In his dissertation, he explores the interaction between ruling parties and citizens in closed authoritarian regimes, the strategies ruling parties implement to maintain stability, and citizens political behavior towards the ruling party.

**[Louis-Philippe Brochu](https://government.cornell.edu/louis-philippe-brochu)**

Louis-Philippe is a PhD student in comparative politics, studying authoritarian politics in post-communist societies. He is particularly attentive to the role that identity, affect, and memory play in either inspiring or discouraging resistance to authoritarian regimes, as well as to how authoritarian elites seek to legitimate their rule. Research on historical persistence, religion, and the legacies of violence also fall within the purview of my scholarly interests.
